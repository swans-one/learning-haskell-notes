* Lookups

In the following exercises, use the following terms to make the
expressions type-check:

1. ~pure~
2. ~(<$>)~ or ~fmap~
3. ~(<*>)~

Make the following expressions typecheck

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
import Data.List (elemIndex)

-- 1
added :: Maybe Integer
added = fmap (+3) (lookup 3 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6])

-- 2
y :: Maybe Integer
y = lookup 3 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

z :: Maybe Integer
z = lookup 2 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

tupled :: Maybe (Integer, Integer)
tupled = fmap (,) y <*> z

-- 3
x :: Maybe Int
x = elemIndex 3 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

y :: Maybe Int
y = elemIndex 4 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

max' :: Int -> Int -> Int
max' = max

maxed :: Maybe Int
maxed = pure max' <*> x <*> y

-- 4
xs = [1, 2, 3]
ys = [4, 5, 6]

x :: Maybe Integer
x = lookup 3 $ zip xs ys

y :: Maybe Integer
y = lookup 2 $ zip xs ys

summed :: Maybe Integer
summed = fmap sum $ fmap (,) x <*> y
